Radiance: 2691 is an arcade-style top-down shooter with nowhere near enough color.  Upgrade your ship, recruit helpers, and blast your enemies to gain as many points as you can!

This game was made as a proof of concept over the course of a week for the game jams [A Monthly Game Jam - July 2022](https://itch.io/jam/amgj-july2022) and [One Game a Month #14](https://itch.io/jam/one-game-a-month-14).  This project is no longer being active developed.

The final game submission can be played directly in your browser here: [Radiance: 2691 on itch.io](https://mitchellopitz.itch.io/radiance-2691).

# How to Play

Move your player and shoot the enemies!  As you defeat them, you will gain experience and level up.  Each level will award one additional point you can use to upgrade your ship, recruit helpers, or improve your score.
